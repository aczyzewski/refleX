## Description
RefleX is a machine learning system that aims to automatically detect seven classes of anomalies that may appear in X-ray diffraction images. 

## Dataset
The dataset contains 6311 X-ray diffraction images in 1024x1024 png format (reflex_img_1024_inter_nearest.zip). The repository also contains a file mapping each image to a set of labels (labels.csv) and files describing the assignment of each image to training, validation, and testing sets (labels_train.csv, labels_val.csv, labels_test.csv).
